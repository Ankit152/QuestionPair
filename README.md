Over 100 million people visit **Quora** every month, so it's no surprise that many people ask similarly worded questions. Multiple questions with the same intent can cause seekers to spend more time finding the best answer to their question, and make writers feel they need to answer multiple versions of the same question. **Quora** values canonical questions because they provide a better experience to active seekers and writers, and offer more value to both of these groups in the long term.
